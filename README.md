# product-filtering-app-nextjs
A Next.js application built with TypeScript that implements a shopping list. The web/app displays product cards fetched from an API, and users can filter products by category and price range using dropdown menus.  The web/app uses the "components with props" technique, where reusable components receive data through props.
